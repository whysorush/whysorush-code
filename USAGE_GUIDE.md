4. **Review Changes**: Examine the proposed changes in the diff viewer
5. **Apply Changes**: Accept the changes that look good
6. **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions like "Also add logging for failed transactions"

### **Workflow 2: Feature Development**
1. **Upload Project**: Upload your project
2. **Describe Feature**: Ask "Create a new React component for data visualization"
3. **Review Generated Code**: Check the generated component in the diff viewer
4. **Customize**: Ask for modifications like "Make it responsive" or "Add dark mode support"
5. **Apply Changes**: Import the new component into your project

### **Workflow 3: Bug Fixes**
1. **Upload Project**: Upload the problematic codebase
2. **Describe Issue**: Ask "Fix the authentication error in the login form"
3. **Review Fixes**: Examine the proposed error handling improvements
4. **Test Changes**: Apply changes and test the functionality
5. **Refine**: Ask for additional improvements if needed

## üîß Integration with Other Panels

### **Code Editor Panel**
- Upload your project and switch to the **"Code"** tab
- Use the file browser to navigate your project structure
- Edit files directly in the code editor
- Changes made in the editor are reflected in the Composer context

### **Chat Panel**
- Use the general chat interface for broader AI assistance
- Ask questions about programming concepts
- Get help with debugging and problem-solving

### **Memory Panel**
- Track AI learning and context retention
- Review patterns and suggestions from previous sessions

## üé® Best Practices

### **Effective Project Uploads**
- **Include All Relevant Files**: Upload the entire project directory for best context
- **Exclude Large Files**: Skip binary files, images, and large dependencies
- **Include Configuration**: Upload `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc. for better AI understanding
- **Include Documentation**: Upload README files and comments for context

### **Optimizing Composer Usage**
- **Be Specific**: "Add error handling to the login function" vs "Fix bugs"
- **Include Context**: Mention specific files or features in your requests
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build on previous responses for better results
- **Review Changes**: Always examine diffs before applying changes

### **File Context Selection**
- **Relevant Files**: Include only files related to your request
- **Dependencies**: Include imported files and related components
- **Configuration**: Include config files for project-specific context
- **Documentation**: Include README and docs for project understanding

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Upload Issues**
- **Large Projects**: For very large projects, consider uploading in chunks
- **File Permissions**: Ensure you have permission to access the files
- **Browser Support**: Use modern browsers that support directory uploads
- **File Types**: Some file types may not be processed (binary files, images)

### **Composer Issues**
- **No Response**: Check if files are selected in context
- **Poor Suggestions**: Try adding more relevant files to context
- **Changes Not Applying**: Verify file permissions and try again
- **Performance**: Limit context to relevant files for faster responses

### **General Issues**
- **Browser Refresh**: Your uploaded project will persist until you refresh
- **Multiple Projects**: You can upload different projects by using the uploader again
- **Data Loss**: Always backup your work before making major changes

## üîÑ Advanced Features

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Enter**: Send message (when not in multi-line mode)
- **Shift + Enter**: New line in message input
- **Escape**: Close modals and cancel operations
- **Ctrl/Cmd + K**: Quick file search (in context builder)

### **File Management**
- **Drag and Drop**: Some browsers support drag-and-drop file uploads
- **Batch Operations**: Select multiple files for context at once
- **File Filtering**: Use search to find specific files quickly
- **Path Navigation**: Navigate through folder structures easily

### **AI Customization**
- **Context Size**: Adjust the number of files included for optimal performance
- **Response Length**: AI responses can be customized for brevity or detail
- **Code Style**: The AI adapts to your project's coding conventions
- **Language Support**: Supports multiple programming languages

## üìö Example Prompts
