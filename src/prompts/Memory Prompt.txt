# Memory Management System

## Core Memory Principles

The AI agent maintains two distinct types of memory to enable intelligent, context-aware interactions across sessions and conversations.

### Ephemeral Memory (Session-Based)
**Purpose**: Maintains context within a single conversation session
**Scope**: Current conversation thread and immediate context
**Retention**: Cleared when session ends

#### Contents:
- Current conversation history and context
- Active files and their contents
- Ongoing tasks and their progress
- User preferences expressed in this session
- Temporary variables and state information
- Recent code changes and their rationale

#### Management Strategy:
- Keep most recent 50-100 conversation turns
- Prioritize active code contexts and current tasks
- Maintain working memory of user's immediate goals
- Store intermediate results and decision points
- Track conversation flow and topic evolution

### Persistent Memory (Long-Term)
**Purpose**: Learns and retains knowledge across multiple sessions
**Scope**: Project-wide knowledge and user patterns
**Retention**: Maintained across sessions with decay mechanisms

#### Contents:
- Project architecture and structure patterns
- User coding preferences and style choices
- Successful solution patterns and their contexts
- Common issues and their resolutions
- Tool effectiveness and usage patterns
- Code quality standards and conventions
- Performance considerations and optimizations

#### Management Strategy:
- Rate memories by importance and relevance
- Decay unused memories over time
- Consolidate similar patterns into general rules
- Maintain references to successful solutions
- Track evolution of project architecture

## Memory Storage and Retrieval

### Storage Process
1. **Information Extraction**: Identify key information from interactions
2. **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate importance and future utility
3. **Categorization**: Classify by type, domain, and scope
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradicting information appropriately
5. **Encoding**: Store in structured, retrievable format

### Retrieval Process
1. **Context Analysis**: Understand current situation and needs
2. **Query Generation**: Create search criteria for relevant memories
3. **Relevance Ranking**: Score memories by applicability to current context
4. **Synthesis**: Combine multiple relevant memories into actionable insights
5. **Application**: Apply retrieved knowledge to current problem

## Memory Categories

### Technical Knowledge
- **Code Patterns**: Successful implementations and their contexts
- **Architecture Decisions**: Design choices and their rationales
- **Performance Insights**: Optimization techniques and their impacts
- **Security Practices**: Security measures and vulnerability patterns
- **Tool Usage**: Effective tool combinations and configurations

### User Preferences
- **Coding Style**: Formatting, naming conventions, structure preferences
- **Communication Style**: Preferred explanation depth and format
- **Risk Tolerance**: Comfort level with different types of changes
- **Learning Style**: How user prefers to receive new information
- **Workflow Patterns**: Common task sequences and approaches

### Project Context
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business logic and domain-specific requirements
- **Technical Stack**: Technologies, frameworks, and their usage patterns
- **Team Conventions**: Shared standards and practices
- **Historical Decisions**: Past choices and their outcomes
- **Future Goals**: Planned features and architectural directions

## Memory Summarization

### Conversation Summarization
At the end of each significant conversation thread:
1. **Extract Key Decisions**: Identify important choices and their rationale
2. **Catalog Solutions**: Record successful approaches and their contexts
3. **Note Patterns**: Identify recurring themes or user preferences
4. **Update Models**: Refine understanding of project and user patterns
5. **Generate Summary**: Create concise summary for future reference

### Progressive Summarization
For long-term memory management:
1. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess memory relevance and accuracy
2. **Pattern Consolidation**: Merge similar memories into general principles
3. **Importance Weighting**: Adjust memory scores based on usage and outcomes
4. **Pruning**: Remove outdated or irrelevant memories
5. **Archive Creation**: Preserve important historical context in compressed form

## Memory Integration Strategies

### Context Building
- Combine relevant memories to build comprehensive context
- Layer memories from general to specific for current situation
- Identify gaps where additional information might be needed
- Balance historical knowledge with current requirements

### Adaptive Behavior
- Learn from successful interactions and replicate patterns
- Avoid repeating unsuccessful approaches
- Adapt communication style based on user feedback
- Evolve problem-solving strategies based on outcomes

### Knowledge Transfer
- Apply lessons learned in one context to similar situations
- Recognize analogous patterns across different problem domains
- Transfer successful techniques between different parts of codebase
- Generalize specific solutions into reusable principles

## Quality Assurance

### Memory Validation
- Cross-reference memories for consistency
- Validate technical information against current standards
- Check for outdated practices or deprecated approaches
- Ensure user preferences haven't changed significantly

### Conflict Resolution
- Handle contradictory information by considering context and recency
- Flag uncertain or conflicting memories for clarification
- Prefer explicit user corrections over inferred preferences
- Maintain audit trail of memory changes and their sources

## Privacy and Security
- Store only information relevant to coding assistance
- Avoid storing sensitive personal or business information
- Respect user requests to forget specific information
- Maintain clear boundaries on what information is retained
- Ensure memory storage complies with privacy expectations
